## Right ToF mounting correction

The right sensor is recessed 10 mm. The forward sketch subtracts RIGHT_TOF_INSET_MM = 10 from valid right readings before wall detection and both steering cases; telemetry labels R as corrected. Invalid readings remain invalid, and corrected negative clearances clamp to zero. Both side targets are now 40 mm from the chassis edge. The previous right target of 50 mm raw becomes 40 mm corrected, preserving its physical setpoint without compensating twice. Calibration sketches continue to report raw sensor ranges.

# Seven-cell forward test: two-wall and one-wall guidance

The forward implementation is packaged as `MoveForward.h` and `MoveForward.cpp`. The header contains the reusable controller types and the module entry points; the implementation owns the ESP32, motor, encoder, ToF, MPU6050, WiFi, command, and telemetry details. `moving_forward.ino` is only a thin Arduino adapter that calls `moveForwardSetup()` and `moveForwardLoop()`. Copy those three files into another Arduino sketch folder to reuse the module; call `moveForwardStop()` when an external component must stop it.

Send `start` over WiFi TCP port 23 or USB Serial at 115200 baud. The robot moves seven 180 mm cells, continuously, with no intermediate cell stops. After cell seven it stays stopped. Send `d` during movement to cancel the remaining run. A new start begins a new seven-cell sequence, not the remainder of an interrupted run. No automatic startup movement occurs. Blocking sensor reads and WiFi writes can delay command handling.

## WiFi connection

The ESP32 connects to the WiFi network configured by `WIFI_SSID` and `WIFI_PASSWORD`. Its transmit power is limited with `WiFi.setTxPower(WIFI_POWER_8_5dBm)` to reduce radio power consumption.

1. Upload the sketch and reset the ESP32.
2. Open USB Serial at 115200 baud and note the printed ESP32 IP address.
3. Connect a TCP terminal to that IP address on port 23.
4. Send `s` or `start` to begin the seven-cell run. Send `d` at any time to stop.

The TCP terminal receives movement telemetry and MPU yaw readings. USB Serial remains usable if WiFi initialization or connection fails.

## Why the controller changed

The earlier PID applied the opposite motor command change to the hardware-tested base sketch. For a small left distance, main.ino reduces the named left motor command to 30 and keeps the right at 70; the PID increased the left and reduced the right. The old test also stopped wheels independently, potentially rotating the robot while one wheel finished its target. This version follows the working base sketch's command convention and brakes both together when either wheel reaches its calibrated limit.

## Active movement logic

| Side readings | Left command | Right command |
|---|---:|---:|
| Valid left below 40 mm | 30 | 70 |
| Otherwise, valid right below 40 mm | 70 | 30 |
| Otherwise | 70 | 70 |

The left condition takes priority if both thresholds trigger. These are pre-balance commands: factors remain left 1.0 and right 0.78. The table describes cruise speed. During the approach, the distance PID reduces the base command from 70 toward 35; a wall correction still slows the same motor to 30. The movement loop delay is 10 ms, as in main.ino. Motor pins, polarity, and braking outputs are unchanged. Both thresholds now use 40 mm chassis clearance; lateral correction remains threshold-based. A separate encoder-distance PID controls forward approach speed.

Tune `FORWARD_SPEED`, `WALL_SLOW_SPEED`, `LEFT_WALL_THRESHOLD_MM`, `RIGHT_WALL_THRESHOLD_MM`, `LEFT_FACTOR`, and `RIGHT_FACTOR` in `MoveForward.cpp`. `MoveForward.h` contains the reusable control types and encoder stopping rule. The last manually tuned PID values observed before this change were Kp=0.2, Ki=0, Kd=0, correction limit=40; those old lateral PID gains are not active.

Each run uses one encoder baseline and total limits of 4314 left / 4322 right ticks, derived from the two seven-cell hand-pushed measurements. Both wheels brake when either limit is reached, just like main.ino's OR condition. This intentionally differs from requiring both wheel targets. It can shorten travel if wheel progress differs, so measure total distance instead of assuming 180 mm or 1260 mm is exact.

## Reducing endpoint overshoot

The cell-approach controller in `MoveForward.h` adds encoder-distance PID without reversing the working wall steering. It uses the smaller remaining count to either wheel's braking threshold, matching the rule that both motors stop at the first encoder limit. Outside the final 300 ticks (about 87 mm), the base PWM is 70. Inside that zone, PID reduces base PWM toward a floor of 35. The wall controller can still reduce the corresponding side to 30. All commands are before motor balance factors.

Edit `APPROACH_SETTINGS` in the sketch:

- Kp = 0.24 PWM/tick; Ki = 0.01 PWM/(tick*second); Kd = 0.01 PWM*second/tick. These are initial, unverified physical tuning values.
- `APPROACH_SLOWDOWN_TICKS = 300`. A larger zone permits earlier deceleration, but speed is also determined by the PID output.
- `MIN_APPROACH_PWM = 35`. Lower cautiously if the robot still overshoots; both motors must remain able to roll under load.
- `BRAKE_LEAD_TICKS = 10`, requesting braking approximately 2.9 mm before the nominal seven-cell endpoint. Effective thresholds are 4304 left / 4312 right ticks. Increase gradually; this changes the braking point, not the distance calibration.

Keep integral small: this is an endpoint approach, not a speed regulator. PID state resets at each run, output is bounded, and integral accumulation is suppressed at the limits. Encoder crossing triggers joint braking regardless of PID state.

Each run reports counts at braking and counts added during the following 100 ms. This separates target-crossing delay from rolling after braking. Measure actual travel too: tire slip and motion after the 100 ms reporting window are not captured by that difference. Blocking sensor/network calls can delay endpoint checks. The change should reduce approach speed; exact 1260 mm stopping still needs hardware tuning.

## Sensors and stop conditions

ToF startup matches the working calibration/tof_readings sketch: Wire.begin(), 10 ms shutdown, left/right/front wake order with 50 ms delays, addresses 0x30/0x31/0x32, timeouts of 200 ms after address assignment, and front Medium mode with startContinuous(30). Status is reported after initialization rather than aborting at intermediate checks.

A valid front ToF reading at or below `FRONT_EMERGENCY_STOP_MM = 40` brakes both motors immediately before side sensor reads. The run ends and requires a new `start`; clearing the obstacle does not resume it. This threshold is measured from the sensor face; actual stopping clearance depends on sampling and braking travel. Invalid front readings, both side readings invalid, encoder stall, whole-run timeout (105 seconds), or d cancel the run. A single invalid side is excluded from steering; the valid side can still request correction. Invalid readings are shown as -1. The old side-distance-sum guard and 8 mm side stop are not used. MPU feedback is used in one-wall and no-wall modes. Front-wall alignment is not implemented.

## Case 2: one usable side wall plus MPU yaw

Case 1 keeps its tested main.ino threshold steering. Case 2 uses a dedicated wall-distance PID. Targets are 40 mm chassis clearance on both sides, with +/-3.6 mm tolerance; the right reading is corrected for its 10 mm inset first. Outside that band, positive signed error (left wall too close or right wall too far) slows the left motor; negative error slows the right. The amount is proportional/integral/derivative feedback rather than a fixed drop straight to 30 PWM. MPU trim remains secondary: it operates only inside the distance band and cannot override a distance correction.

Tune these named constants in `MoveForward.cpp`:

- `SINGLE_WALL_KP = 3.0`: PWM per millimeter of distance error.
- `SINGLE_WALL_KI = 0.0`: no accumulated distance correction.
- `SINGLE_WALL_KD = 0.05`: light damping per millimeter/second of error change.
- `SINGLE_WALL_MAX_PWM = 40`: maximum wall correction, further limited by current approach speed and minimum motor PWM 30.

The PID uses actual sample time. State resets at each run, on a wall-side change, on return to two-wall mode, and inside the distance tolerance band. Conditional integration limits windup using the available motor-speed range. Derivative action can reduce a correction as error improves; outside the band, the output is restricted to the established correction direction. These are initial hardware tuning gains.

`MoveForward.h` owns wall-mode detection and the one-wall control law. The private MPU implementation in `MoveForward.cpp` uses direct MPU6050 register reads at address 0x68 on the existing SDA 21/SCL 22 bus. It verifies the identity, calibrates Z-axis bias from 200 stationary samples, selects DLPF_6 and the +/-500 dps range, applies a 0.5 dps deadband, and integrates yaw without a software Kalman filter. A control-loop delay longer than 100 ms skips that unsafe integration interval but does not permanently invalidate a successful fresh reading.

The MPU reader matches the rotation mechanism and reports physical clockwise/right turns as positive. `MPU_YAW_SIGN` remains available for mounting correction; the current value is +1. A value of 0 disables case 2. All controller yaw values are normalized to right-positive after applying the sign.

At each start, relative yaw is zeroed once. Keep the robot level and parallel to the intended corridor direction at that moment. Yaw is not reset at individual cell boundaries or when switching wall modes, so accumulated heading error is not accepted as a new straight direction. Gyro yaw is relative and can drift; this is for the short seven-cell test, not long-term localization.

MPU updates are serviced approximately every 10 ms, including while the ToFs complete their measurements and while stopped between cells. ToF acquisition preserves front/left/right order and side single-shot measurements but polls readiness cooperatively instead of blocking for whole measurements. No separate task accesses the I2C bus. Network stalls can still delay sampling. A gap over 100 ms or a failed gyro read invalidates yaw until a new start resets it; case 2 stops while yaw is invalid. Case 1 does not depend on MPU health.

Wall detection uses hysteresis: acquire a usable wall below 120 mm and retain it below 140 mm. A healthy side sensor that completes a measurement but reports no target/out of range is represented as `SIDE_NO_TARGET_MM = 200`, above both detection thresholds, so a wall one or more cells away does not become a guidance wall. I2C failures and measurement timeouts still set `sideCommunicationFault` and cancel movement. One detected wall selects case 2, two select case 1, and no nearby walls select case 3.

Initial `SINGLE_WALL_SETTINGS` values:

| Setting | Value |
|---|---:|
| Left / right target clearance | 40 / 40 mm from the chassis edge |
| Distance deadband | +/-3.6 mm |
| Wall correction | PID reduction up to 40 PWM; motor command floor 30 |
| MPU use | Only within the wall-distance tolerance band |
| Heading proportional gain | 2 PWM/degree |
| Yaw-rate damping | 0.15 PWM/(degree/second) |
| Maximum MPU trim | 15 PWM |
| Minimum commanded motor PWM | 30, before balance factors |

The one-wall controller only slows a wheel; it never raises either above the existing distance-PID approach speed. During the final approach, available steering reduction shrinks to preserve the minimum command. Single-wall targets reuse the case-1 thresholds: 40 mm left and 40 mm corrected right. Verify actual chassis clearance during hardware tuning. Case-1 behavior is unchanged apart from applying the known right-sensor inset correction.

Test a left-only corridor and then a right-only corridor. Telemetry labels case two / left+MPU / right+MPU, and reports normalized yaw, wall error, wall PID PWM, and MPU trim separately. A nonzero wall error selects wall PID; zero wall error enables the limited MPU trim. Check corrections from slightly closer and farther positions, then check two-to-one and one-to-two wall transitions. Seven continuous cells, final-approach distance PID, brake lead applied once at the end, and start/d behavior remain active.

## Case 3: no side walls

When neither side wall is detected, the no-wall controller in `MoveForward.h` combines calibrated encoder progress with MPU yaw. Entering case 3 captures the current left/right counts, so corrections made before the open area do not create an immediate encoder error. While the MPU is healthy, steering is an 80% MPU / 20% encoder blend; opposing corrections cancel instead of slowing both motors. If either wall returns, the controller resets and the movement loop switches to case 1 or case 2 on that sample. Case 3 falls back to 100% encoder control if the MPU is unavailable.

Positive encoder correction slows the left motor; negative correction slows the right motor. The user verified that each physical motor and encoder has the same left/right label, so the wheel ahead in calibrated travel must be slowed. The active case-3 PID is:

- Encoder PID: Kp = 1.7, Ki = 0.10, Kd = 0.0.
- Encoder PID output limit = 40 PWM.
- MPU heading trim: Kp = 2.0, yaw-rate damping = 1.5, output limit = 15 PWM, blend weight = 80%.

Encoder error compares distance progress using the two manual seven-cell trials: 4363/4360 and 4265/4283 ticks. Their averages are 4314 left and 4321.5 right over 1260 mm, or about 616.286/617.357 ticks per cell. Comparing normalized progress means this expected count difference represents equal travel rather than steering error. Telemetry labels this mode `none:encoder+MPU` and prints encoder error/PWM and MPU trim. On this robot, extra left-encoder progress reduces the left command, and extra right-encoder progress reduces the right command. Ki corrects persistent residual imbalance; conditional integration prevents windup while the output is limited.

## Verification

Start parallel to a straight corridor and keep d available. At readings 32/68 mm, telemetry must show commands 30/70. At corrected readings 47/39 mm it must show 70/30. At 44/55 mm it must show 70/70. Verify the physical corrections match the behavior of your base sketch. Record final heading, total travel, and left/right counts at the final stop. Verify the front emergency brake and d command before distance trials.

Host checks:

- `tests/single_wall_test.cpp`: wall classification/hysteresis, both one-wall sides, heading/rate corrections, and command bounds.
- `tests/cell_approach_test.cpp`: distance-PID deceleration, output limits, reset, anti-windup, and brake-lead arithmetic.
- `tests/forward_wall_control_test.cpp`: recorded sensor examples, threshold boundaries, left-first priority, invalid-side handling, and joint encoder braking.
- `tests/check_movement_sequence.ps1`: extracts the actual movement functions and runs them with fake time, sensors, and motors; checks continuous seven-cell travel without intermediate stops, joint braking, front readings of 39/40/41 mm, obstacle detection during motion, d during motion, and cancellation after sensor faults.
- `tests/no_wall_test.cpp`: checks case 3 reference capture, the manual left/right calibration, both steering directions, integral correction, and anti-windup.
- `tests/movement_commands_test.cpp`: USB/WiFi command parsing.

These checks passed with g++ using C++11 and warnings as errors. They do not simulate mechanical dynamics. ESP32 compilation and physical verification remain pending.
